<h3>Peano and the infinite range of natural numbers</h3>
<p>We have seen how in the standard library we have many finite, but gigantic, number types:
There are  2<sup>64</sup> - 1 instances of <code>Nat</code> and there are 96<sup>2,147,483,647</sup> âˆ’ 1 instances of <code>Str</code>.
Each <code>Nat</code> can be stored in exactly 4 bytes, were a byte is eight bit.
Strings use an incremental space consumption; this means that storing small strings would use only a little amount of memory (with 34 bytes being the minimum size; much more than the 4 bytes needed for a <code>Nat</code>.</p>
<p>On the other extreme, storing a single element of a string near to the maximum representable size would take about 2 GB (two giga bytes).
2 GB is a large amount of memory, but nowadays we have computers with thousands of times more memory than that.
Such a string would be very, very long. If we were to print it on conventional A4 paper with the standard 10 points font size and make a book out of it, that book would be more than 30 meters tall; taller than a 10-storey building.
Big, but still not infinite. I mean, actually quite small,... we have many buildings taller than that!</p>
<p>Can we represent an actual infinite set of numbers?
Of course we would not be able to actually store in memory numbers of any size; but we can represent numbers as big as our memory allows.
Below, you can see an implementation for Peano numbers.
Peano is a number representation where numbers are represented as a Zero or a Successor of another number.
We can encode Peano numbers in Fearless as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Number:{
  .pred: Number,
  .succ: Number -&gt; {this}, // equivalent to .pred-&gt;this
  }
Zero:Number { this.pred } // equivalent to .pred-&gt;this.pred
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it is confusingly simple and minimal.
Here some examples of peano numbers:</p>
<pre><code>Zero  //0
Zero.succ  //1 == {Zero}
Zero.succ.succ //2 ==  {{Zero}}
</code></pre>
<p>By continuing this sequence, we can represent any kind of number.
With <code>Nat</code>, there was a type representing zero, a type representing one, a type representing two and so on.
Note how this is not the case for Peano numbers. There is not a type representing the number one, two and so on.
Numbers are created as needed using the <code>Number.succ</code> method.</p>
<p>We can add operations to our Peano numbers as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Number:{
  .pred: Number,
  .succ:Number-&gt;{ this },
  +(other: Number): Number -&gt; this.pred + (other.succ),
  *(other: Number): Number -&gt; this + (this.pred * other),
  }
Zero:Number {
  .pred -&gt; this.pred,
  +(other) -&gt; other,
  *(other) -&gt; this,
 }
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this is very similar to the way we encoded those operations for finite number sets, like <code>Nat</code>.
The fearless standard library does not support Peano numbers. As we have shown you, it is very easy to implement them if you need.</p>
<p>However, the fearless standard library supports the <code>Num</code> type.
A value of type <code>Num</code> represents an arbitrary large fractional number.
Something of the form <code>a/b</code> where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a</code> can be an arbitrary large integer number; positive or negative.</li>
<li><code>b</code> can be an arbitrary large positive natural number, (different from zero).</li>
</ul>
<p>This is now a good time to summarise how to write numbers in fearless:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Nat</code> is the type of natural numbers, and we write them as <code>0</code>,<code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,....</li>
<li><code>Int</code> is the type of signed integers, and we write them as <code>-2</code>,<code>-1</code>,<code>+0</code>, <code>+1</code>, <code>+2</code>,...</li>
<li><code>Num</code> is the type of arbitrarily large fractions, and we write them as <code>+12/1</code>, <code>-13.004/75.5</code>, ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, if we use the fraction symbol <code>/</code> we talk about those arbitrarily large fractional numbers.
It is very common to write large numbers followed by <code>/1</code> as a way to specify that we mean arbitrary size numbers.
For example <code>+249023892334949590290854892389343489723789478923/1</code> is a very large instance of <code>Num</code>; much bigger than what it can be represented with <code>Nat</code> or <code>Int</code>.</p>
